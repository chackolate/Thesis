The Infrared Scene Projector (IRSP) market has developed to require high resolution, frame rates, and dynamic range for projected videos. Within the IRSP, Infrared LEDs (IRLEDS) are driven by analog signals from a control circuit. These LEDS require precise output levels and consequently the system utilizes hardware-in-the-loop monitoring of output. The analog subsystem of our IRSP demands high integrity and hardware capabilities to avoid bottlenecks and deliver clean signals. This paper describes a newly designed testing procedure for the IRSP's current analog system, as well as the lessons learned from this process used towards designing the analog component of our next generation IRSP.
