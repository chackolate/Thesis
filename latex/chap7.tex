\chapter{Development of a Formal Testing Procedure}
\section{Initial considerations}
The new procedure was to be a direct response to the previous one. Based on complaints and difficulties from all who had to use the setup, we compiled a list of the biggest concerns and focused the procedure design around them. These included:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Manually changing input/output channels was slow and introduced too many steps
	\item Input \& output were connected through a flimsy probe clip
	\item No way to separate amp power rails
	\item No indication if the amps were receiving sufficient power
	\item No data collection for comparison between cards
	\item No standards or documentation for gain/offset potentiometer tweaks
\end{itemize}
