\chapter{Conclusion}
The amplifier test platform is a model to be applied to all hardware across the project. Without documentation on original design processes and intentions it is impossible to qualify the performance of a given hardware component. \par
Good design is not possible without thorough testing, and the insights gleaned from exploring the original architecture helped in the development of a current testing procedure and future hardware redesign.\par
At the time of writing, testing of the new amplifiers is still ongoing. With reliable and proactive analog design the IRSP will be a much more viable device for wider applications in the future.
