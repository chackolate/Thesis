I would like to thank my parents Thomas and Ambika, my sister Christy, and my cat Freya for their unwavering support and love throughout my school and research career. \par
I would also like to thank the team at CDS and CVORG. My advisor Dr. Fouad Kiamilev offered me access to a practical research opportunity as an undergraduate I could never have hoped to receive elsewhere. This project has given me new perspectives on engineering and collective leadership. \par
My teammates and coworkers have cultivated a warm and encouraging research environment. We are all working towards common objectives and are never discouraged from asking questions and experimenting. The entire CVORG and CDS community made honing in on my specific interests a natural process. I would, however, like to specifially like to thank my fellow graduate and undergraduate researchers Hagan Beatson, Michael Richards, Mike Joyce and Matt Greenlee for their dedication, shared curiosity, and collaborative natures during our work together. Former and present senior group members and employees including Alexis Deputy, Jaclyn Singh, Tianne Lassitter, Miguel Hernandez, Tyler Browning, Aaron Landwehr, Chris Jackson and Daniel May have also offered invaluable help and guidance throughout my time in the group. Thank you all so much.
